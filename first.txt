◾ GUI (Graphical user interface) => It refers to an interface that allows one to

      A shell is a computer program that presents a command line interface which allows you to control 
      your computer using commands entered with a keyboard instead of controlling graphical user 
      interfaces (GUIs) with a mouse/keyboard/touchscreen combination

◾ Kernel ==> The kernel is the heart of the operating system. It interacts with the hardware and most of the tasks 
      like memory management, task scheduling and file management The computer programs that allocate the system resources
